<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
**Cloudflare Dynamic DNS Updater** is a light, reliable, and automated solution designed to keep your home or office network's public IP address consistently synchronized with a **Cloudflare DNS record**.

This project solves the common problem for users with dynamic IPs (like most residential connections) who want to run a server or service accessible via a fixed domain name. By leveraging the **Cloudflare API**, it automatically detects changes to your public IP address and instantly updates your specified DNS record, ensuring your service is always reachable.

---

### Features
- **Cloudflare API Integration:** Securely updates A-records using the official Cloudflare API.
- **Dynamic IP Detection:** Reliably checks your current public IP address against the existing DNS record.
- **Automated Synchronization:** Only updates the record when the IP address has genuinely changed, minimizing API calls.
- **Support for Multiple Domains/Records:** Easily configure and manage updates for multiple hosts or subdomains.
- **Flexible Deployment:** Designed to run easily on various platforms (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Docker, a local server).


### Built With

* [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Setting up this solution on your local machine is straightforward and will enable you to fully utilize its capabilities. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to get everything running smoothly.

Before beginning, ensure that your development environment is properly configured. Having the required software and dependencies installed will prevent common issues and streamline the process.

### Prerequisites

### Installation
This installation method utilizes Docker Compose for a streamlined setup. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

1.  **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:**
    Create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` in a directory of your choice. Copy and paste the following content into it:

    ```yaml
    version: '3.4'
    name: cloudflare-dynamic-dns
    services:
      cloudflare.dynamic.dns:
        container_name: "cloudflare-dynamic-dns"
        image: ghcr.io/jellebuning/cloudflare-dynamic-dns
        environment:
          CF_ZONE_ID: "<cloudflare_zone_id>"
          CF_API_TOKEN: "<cloudflare_api_token>"
          CF_DOMAIN_NAMES: "one.domain.com, two.domain.com"

    ```

2.  **Run Docker Compose:**
    In the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This command will download the necessary images, create the containers, and start them in detached mode.
